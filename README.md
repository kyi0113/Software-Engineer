# Software-Engineer
Personal Repository showcasing "sdstaley/UT9_HERMES" group repository.

This project for CSC 4350 Software Engineering course challenged a group of 5 students to develop a messaging service app designed for a user to have a platform that enables them to send a message to a recipient across all social media/messaging services, which may include: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and IMessenger. 

# Purpose of Assignment:
To provide my classmates and I a role-play environment where we get to experience what an agile development team would do in a company. Rotations of job positions such as PM, SM, and Programmers were changed every other scrum meeting.

# Challenges:
- Experienced risk management scenarios when students would have to delay project deadlines due to family emergencies.
- Collaboration and communication with students who were not in the United States.
- Allocation of balanced workload amongst all students.
- Computer specifications for some students fell below the minimum requirements for specific software applications.
